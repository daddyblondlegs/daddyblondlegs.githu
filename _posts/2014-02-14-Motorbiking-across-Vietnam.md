  <p>For just $300, you get your very own motorcycle. Not rent, completely own. Granted they&#39;re all ticking time bombs waiting to have a fatal fail. The other two guys I was with had a lot of experience riding dirt bikes growing up, but they asked me to go to Vietnam with them anyway (and to think I almost said no). So it was just me out there on that dirt road learning how to shift. Slip your toe under the peg and pull up to shift up, and step down to shift down. Trying to juggle all that with throttle, steering, and balance is the trick, but like a baby deer, there wasn&#39;t a lot of time to practice. Soon we were being guided out of Hanoi by the bike shop owner&#39;s girlfriend, taking us to a major highway out of the city. From there, we were on our own.</p>

<p>We arrived around the Tet holiday. On our first night, we came to a ton where everything was closed, including restaurants and grocery stores. We had no way to get food. As we were asking for grocery stores, someone noticed our peril and gave us a massive rice loaf wrapped in banana leaves.</p>

<p>Our bikes were constantly having problems. Mine stopped working after I drove it into a guardrail. It seemed like we were at a mechanics every three days, but looking back it was all part of the fun. One night, my bike wouldn&#39;t start because we&#39;d just filled it with gas from a water bottle. It was the only option out in rural villages. We were stranded and without a place to stay. While asking if we could sleep at the school across the street, the town&#39;s mayor invited us to eat dinner with his family. We joined the rest of the family in an out-building to awkwardly eat their food without being able to communicate much. After the meal, they showed us to a guest room, and the three of us slept in a massive bed. The next morning, we realize how fortunate we were to have broken down here. We&#39;d almost ridden through one of the most beautiful parts of the trip in the dark.</p>

<p>In a little roadside village, a man held out a pocket knife to show me that it said US on it, and then he made a digging motion and pointed to the mountains across the way. He also made a gesture that made us think he had dog tags too. Another man nearby wanted me to take a picture with him and his grandson. From what we could gather from his drawings and the sounds he made, he&#39;d shot down a helicopter and was awarded a medal. You can see the plaque hanging from the second floor banister. There were times when we told people we were Canadian; just so there&rsquo;s no hard feelings.</p>

<p>Vietnam&rsquo;s scenery changes dramatically as you move south: from tropical rainforests to arid hills. Palm trees turn to pine trees, and the dirt becomes an unfriendly red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pair of women waved at me going the opposite direction on a sandy ocean road. I waved back, but lost control and hit a patch of sand the tipped my bike. In the previous falls, I&#39;d hurt my wrist from catching myself, and so this time I landed on my shoulder. It felt dislocated, so I spent the rest of the night in our $15 beach-side room trying to pop it back. Later I learned that a muscle holding the collar bone had torn. Now, one collar bone sticks up a little bit; it&#39;s become a kind of badge of honor even though it was caused by being an idiot.</p>

<p>I could still ride the remaining few days to Ho Chi Minh City, yet I found myself riding on the back of a friend&#39;s bike while another drove mine. The guy driving mine had a piston seize and then proceeded to set his on fire because he said that&#39;s game over. Somewhere on the back of that motorcycle it dawned on me that it made no sense why he was driving mine. It was hard for me to stand up for myself, but I managed to say that I wanted to drive the rest of the way. We switched places and I rode the rest of the way into 5 lanes of stop-and-go nightmare traffic into the country&#39;s largest city. I&#39;d not had this accomplishment if I&#39;d just let it go.</p>

<p>As a bonus, the great part about the company I bought my bike from is that they bought it back from me in HCMC for about $200.</p>

<p>The ride inspired a trip to India that failed and became a trip to Malaysia, and a real cool trip to Myanmar.</p>
