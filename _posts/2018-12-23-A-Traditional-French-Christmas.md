<p>Granted it&rsquo;s well past the fact, but no one really reads this blog anyway.</p>

<p>In America, Christmas is a time to decorate our homes with whatever didn&rsquo;t melt in the attic the year before and to listen to a genre of songs so tacky that we make exceptions for Alvin and the Chipmunks. But in France, there isn&rsquo;t this same hysteria necessitating countless movies, songs, and decor which have begun to emerge on the other side of November&rsquo;s third-Thursday. Rather for the French, it&rsquo;s all about the food, meaning the holiday is more comparable to our Thanksgiving than Christmas. I was lucky enough to have a friend invite me to celebrate it with her family.</p>

<p>Smoked salmon from a four-star hotel with cream, homemade <em>foie gras</em> (duck liver p&acirc;t&eacute;), and bread with nuts.</p>

<p>Capon is a male chicken that has been castrated so its hormone imbalance makes it grow fatter and softer than any chicken you&rsquo;ve eaten before. While its price keeps it from being eaten year-round, it&rsquo;s central to the Christmas dinner table. Filled with a mushroom-based stuffing and accompanied with chestnuts and sweet potatoes.</p>

<p>Saint-Jacques, a common name for scallops, command a tender kiss straight from the sea with a little gristle when you get to the orange part. Tangy sauce for a spin.</p>

<p>Though not strictly a Christmas dish, this cake&rsquo;s pillowy strawberry body set atop a bed of pistachio was more than welcome. Her mom stores bottles of wine in a cellar and pops one open after some time, pouring out M&eacute;doc of a fifteen-year vintage as if saying, &ldquo;oh this ol&rsquo; thang?&rdquo;.</p>
